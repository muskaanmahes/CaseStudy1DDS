Assignment: Case Study 1: Prediciting Employee Attrition at Frito Lay

Executive Summary:
DDSAnalytics was hired by Frito-Lay to identify which key factors influence employee attrition, and to develop predicitve models to help reduce turnover. Frito-Lay states that its turnover ranges from 50% to 400% of an employee's anual salary. Therefore, identifying employees at risk can reduce and improve Frito-Lays stability. 

Two machine learning models were built to predict turnover risk. K-Nearest Neighbors and the Naive Bayes model were built and tested on all features of the dataset. The Naive Bayes model performed the best by correctly identifying 57% of employees liekly to leave and 88% of those likely to stay. Additionally, using a $200 incentive could help Frito-Lay save around $300,000-$2.6 million through reduced turnover.
